Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Writing tool template files for Galaxy can sometimes be extended and error-prone
        process, especially if you're not a programmer or inexperienced in XML and
        templating systems. *bioscripts.galgen* is a Python library that packages a
        script for generating the files that Galaxy requires to wrap a commandline tool
        from a series of interactive questions. For simple tools, these files should be
        complete and ready for use. For more complex tools, they will serve as a useful
        basis for further customization and tweaking.

        Tool generation overview
        ========================
        
        The tool generation script is called ``galgen`` and can be called from the
        commandline as such::
        
        % gen-gtool
        
        Commandline options are available, see below.
        
        The script then asks a series of questions about the tool to be generated: first
        general information about the tool (e.g. is it a script, what version), followed
        by how the tool is called on the commandline (e.g. how many and what sort of
        options). Finally, it steps through each of these options, allowing the user to
        define how these are set. These answers are then used to generate the entry in
        tool_conf.xml, the tool folder and various entries within (e.g. the
        config file).
